# Forecasting-Stores-Sales-prediction
I was presented with a dataset 'train_data.csv' that contains the daily sales for around 1115 stores of a chain. 
In addition, I was provided with the dataset 'store.csv' that contains details for each store. 
My task was to build a model that predicts the daily sales for the 'test' data set. 
In this task, I've built and analyzed tendencies and trends in the data and performed a time forecasting analysis. 
I have computed lag features and other artifacts (e.g. moving average sales, moving sum, etc.) in order to model and predict the sales.
